                        <article>In daily life, I spend most of my time pursuing academic activities. In semester 6, I have a different experience in studying, which is by participating in the MBKM Bangkit 2023 Independent Study program. This program requires me to be more self-directed in learning and self-development by engaging in activities related to the development of soft skills and hard skills. I feel that this program provides a different and interesting learning experience, as well as helps me to become more independent and skilled in time management. In addition, I also take a professional seminar course, which adds to my workload. Therefore, I need better time management to complete these tasks without compromising quality. Besides academic activities, I also enjoy some hobbies such as reading, playing games, and watching anime. I consider these hobbies as a way to unwind after a long day of studying and completing academic tasks. I also feel that these hobbies can help me develop interests and talents, as well as broaden my knowledge in various fields.

                        <article>I started my formal education at SDN 1 Tegal Munjul in 2010. The school is located in a rural area in Purwakarta Regency, West Java. After graduating from elementary school, I continued my education to junior high school at SMPN 7 Purwakarta in 2014. I also started to get involved in student organizations at school, which taught me about leadership. After 3 years of studying at SMPN 7 Purwakarta, I continued my education to senior high school at SMAN 2 Purwakarta in 2017. In high school, I chose the science major because I was interested in science and technology. Additionally, I was also active in extracurricular activities, especially in the field of information technology. After graduating from SMAN 2 Purwakarta in 2020, I continued my education to higher education at the Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia. I chose the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences and the Department of Computer Science because I was interested in information technology and wanted to learn about software and website development.
